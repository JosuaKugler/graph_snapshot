part 1: give python graph edges/nodes attributes
        python graph -> dot language (using netwokx.writedot) -
        - our program modifies dot code to add graph attributes (splines, orientation etc.) -
        - final dot code -> tikz code (dot2tex with program neato)
part 2: provide some nice functions to easily integrate tikzpictures (e.g. in a beamer slide)

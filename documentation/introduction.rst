Introduction
============

graph_snapshot is a tool to visualize graph algorithms based on `networkx <https://networkx.github.io/>`_, `pygraphviz <https://pygraphviz.github.io/>`_ and `dot2tex <https://dot2tex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#>`_. 
Say you have a python script that runs Kruskal's algorithm on a networkx graph and you want to show how the algorithm works in your paper.
